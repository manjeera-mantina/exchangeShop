# exchangeShop
The purpose of the project is to provide to people who would like to have an item that is not being used by us ! Cycling of resources ! The project requires a login for user autheniticity ! The project ensures prompt action from seller by collecting feedback from the purchasor. The project rewards the purchasor who provides feedback on satisfaction of the purchase by providing discount (5% discount awarded for each feedback, 5% deducted from the product price for the next purchase).

The project currently makes a login for new users AND logins in a already registered user. It gives option to "post OR purchase" a specific item for sale from/into the three categories available ! The project gives an option to review the details of the product before confirming the "post OR purchase". The project gives an option to only purchase an item that is not the user's posting ! If it is the user's posting, it can only be edited, but not purchased ! The project gives an option to edit the posting of choose a different product for purchase before confirming. The project also gives an user account edit option before the purchase is confirmed for up-to-date purchasor contact information (address, name and choice of providing feedback). The project currently assigns seller rating only based on any input of choice by purchasor on "prompt response on contacting seller" ! (the contacting the seller via emailing the seller feature has yet to be implemented) The project confirms the post by adding it to the list of items available for purchase and displaying it in the category posted ! The purchase is confirmed by displaying to the user information of the purchase ID, product name and seller name and rating. The product is also displayed as SOLD, to avoid any further purchases of the same prodcut ! On purchase, the purchasor is intimated of email going to be sent for feedback, if the user had chosen to provide feedback ! The project validates all input fields for suitability of input, and checks for secure access on every page to avoid unauthorized access ! Thank you for checking out my project and providing any feedback !
